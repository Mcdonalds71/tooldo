# Progress

The running state of the build. Read this first in a new session, then `CLAUDE.md` for
the rules. Update it at the end of a work session, not during.

## Built

**Foundation.** Astro 7 + React 19 islands, TypeScript strict, Tailwind v4, Biome,
Vitest, Playwright. CI runs typecheck, lint, unit tests, build, smoke tests and a
dependency audit on every pull request.

**Design system.** `src/design-system/tokens.css` is the spine: palette, type, spacing,
radii, shadows, motion, and per-component tokens. Components read tokens and never hold
a literal. Built so far: Button (every variant and state), Card, ToolCard, Badge, Tag,
Progress, Spinner, Dropzone, FileQueue, EmptyState, Toast, ProcessingOverlay,
ResultPanel. A style guide page renders them all at `/design-system`.

**Brand.** Logo set, favicons, manifest, OG card. Clash Display, Inter and JetBrains
Mono, self-hosted.

**Landing.** Floating glass nav capsule, editorial hero bento (headline, showcase card,
rotating stamp, promise card), footer. The showcase card reserves a stage for a tool
animation that isn't built yet.

**Deployed.** Cloudflare Workers, static assets, no Worker script in front of them.

## Next

**Tool 1, PDF Toolbox.** Through the `new-tool` skill so the bar is identical across all
ten. Then the upload animation, then tools 2 to 10.

The upload animation reference is a Dribbble shot by Artem Kucherov. What we take from
it: one footprint holding both idle and working states so nothing jumps when work
starts, a container that physically receives the file, and a live counter that makes
progress feel specific to your file rather than generic. Rendered in warm glass, not the
reference's cool violet. For a PDF tool the counter reads pages, not records.

## Decisions worth knowing

Recorded properly in `docs/adr/`. The ones that catch people out:

- **Clash Display is fetched at build time, not committed.** The Fontshare licence
  forbids redistributing the files and a public repo counts. The URL lives in
  `scripts/fetch-fonts.mjs`, so nothing needs configuring anywhere. A URL is not the
  file. See `public/fonts/README.md`.
- **`'unsafe-inline'` is allowed for scripts and styles** (ADR 0004). Astro's CSP hashing
  silently kills every Radix and Motion inline style, and there is no backend to protect.
- **Astro was upgraded across two majors before tool 1** (ADR 0005). Four pages is the
  cheapest that migration will ever be.
- **`pnpm-workspace.yaml` gates install scripts.** Only listed packages may run them.
  A new dependency that wants one is a supply-chain decision, so it gets added
  deliberately.

## How we work

One tool per session. The repo is the context — `CLAUDE.md`, this file, and the existing
components carry everything a fresh session needs, and conversation history from a
previous tool does not help the next one.

Opus for work that sets a pattern or needs judgment. Sonnet for work that follows a
pattern that already exists.

Build the whole thing, then review it in one pass. Batched changes, not a round trip per
adjustment.
